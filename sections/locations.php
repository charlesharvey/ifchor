				<h2>Description of the map</h2>
				<p>
					We can put some text or contact information over here.
				</p>
				<p>
					The information can change dynamically when the user clicks or hovers on a point on the map. For example the name of the office, its specialties, opening times and contact info can be displayed upon hovering over the correct point. Another possible animation would be to have the names of all the offices show on the right. Upon hovering on the name the correct point lights up on the map.
